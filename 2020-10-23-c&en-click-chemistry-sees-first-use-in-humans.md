summary: A therapy that relies on click chemistry to target a powerful cancer drug at tumor cells, sparing healthy ones, has entered Phase 1 clinical trials. It marks the first time that a click chemistry reaction has been carried out inside a patient’s body, according to Shasqi, the San Francisco–based biotech firm that developed the therapy.

### Targeting mechanism could help to avoid side effects of powerful anticancer drug <br>By [Mark Peplow](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-peplow-0772403/)

It marks the first time that a click chemistry reaction has been carried out inside a patient’s body, according to Shasqi, the San Francisco–based biotech firm that developed the therapy._

> _The work marks a milestone in bioorthogonal chemistry, which relies on reactions that can run inside living organisms without disrupting biochemical processes. So-called click reactions have become a mainstay of this approach because they occur exclusively between two synthetic molecules, rapidly and irreversibly clicking them together. Researchers [already use](https://cen.acs.org/articles/95/i8/Pinning-bulls-eye-cancer-cells.html) bioorthogonal chemistry to tag biomolecules with imaging agents, such as fluorescent probes; and it has helped to manufacture targeted therapeutics, such as [antibody-drug conjugates](https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/cancer/new-generation-antibody-drug-conjugates/98/i14), that have subsequently entered clinical trials._
