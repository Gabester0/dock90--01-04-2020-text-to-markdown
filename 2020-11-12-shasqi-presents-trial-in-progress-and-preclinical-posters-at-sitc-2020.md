Shasqi presents two posters on their lead candidate, SQ3370, at The Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s (SITC) 35th Anniversary Annual Meeting.

In their trial-in-progress poster, Shasqi presents a first-in-human phase I study for their lead candidate SQ3370, a click activated protodrug therapy, in patients with advanced solid tumors. SQ3370 is the first click chemistry-based treatment to be used in humans. The study SQ3370-001 is currently enrolling patients with advanced solid tumors in the United States and Australia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier [NCT04106492](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04106492)).

In another poster, Shasqi presents preclinical data on SQ3370. The findings show that SQ3370 induces a dose-dependent, sustained local and systemic anti-tumor response in two dual-tumor syngeneic mouse models. Additional pharmacological outcomes in the data suggest an immune mediated mechanism which could be further enhanced by checkpoint blockers. The treatment also demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile as it did not induce body weight losses, even at the highest administered dose.

**CAPAC™ and SQ3370**

SQ3370 utilizes Shasqi’s proprietary Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC™) platform, a click chemistry-based approach that activates cancer drugs at a specific tumor with minimal systemic toxicity. The platform utilizes the biocompatible chemical reaction between an attenuated trans-cyclooctene-modified protodrug and a tetrazine-modified biopolymer. The biopolymer is injected into the target tumor lesion, where it precisely captures and activates an infused protodrug. Unlike targeted therapies, the CAPAC™ platform is agnostic to tumor characteristics that can vary from patient to patient, such as biomarker expression and enzymatic activity. CAPAC™ is highly modular and can be applied to a wide variety of cancer therapeutics.

SQ3370 consists of 2 components, SQL70 biopolymer and SQP33 protodrug. SQL70 is a tetrazine-modified sodium hyaluronate biopolymer which functions by activating the protodrug inside the body and does not contain a therapeutically active ingredient. SQP33 is a trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-modified protodrug of Doxorubicin (Dox) with attenuated cytotoxic activity.
