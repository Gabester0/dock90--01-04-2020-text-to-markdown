- Shasqi presents two posters on their lead candidate SQ3370 at CTOS 2020 -

Shasqi presents two posters at The Connective Tissue Oncology Society 25th Anniversary Annual Meeting showcasing their lead candidate SQ3370.

In their preclinical poster, Shasqi shows that SQ3370 induces a dose-dependent, sustained local and systemic anti-tumor response in dual-tumor syngeneic murine models of colon adenocarcinoma, fibrosarcoma and melanoma. Additional pharmacological outcomes suggest SQ3370 activates an immune-mediated response in both treated and untreated tumors. The treatment also demonstrated a favorable toxicity profile as it did not induce body weight losses, even at the highest administered dose.

In addition, Shasqi presents a trial-in-progress poster on a first-in-human phase I study for their lead candidate SQ3370, a click activated protodrug therapy. SQ3370 is the first click chemistry-based treatment to be used in humans. The study SQ3370-001 is currently enrolling patients with advanced sarcomas and other solid tumors in the United States and Australia (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier [NCT04106492](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04106492)).

CAPAC™ and SQ3370

SQ3370 utilizes Shasqi’s proprietary Click Activated Protodrugs Against Cancer (CAPAC™) platform, a click chemistry-based approach that activates cancer drugs at a specific tumor with minimal systemic toxicity. The platform utilizes the biocompatible chemical reaction between an attenuated trans-cyclooctene-modified protodrug and a tetrazine-modified biopolymer. The biopolymer is injected into the target tumor lesion, where it precisely captures and activates an infused protodrug. Unlike targeted therapies, the CAPAC™ platform is agnostic to tumor characteristics that can vary from patient to patient, such as biomarker expression and enzymatic activity. CAPAC™ is highly modular and can be applied to a wide variety of cancer therapeutics.

SQ3370 consists of 2 components, SQL70 biopolymer and SQP33 protodrug. SQL70 is a tetrazine-modified sodium hyaluronate biopolymer which functions by activating the protodrug inside the body and does not contain a therapeutically active ingredient. SQP33 is a trans-cyclooctene (TCO)-modified protodrug of Doxorubicin (Dox) with attenuated cytotoxic activity.
